I have a dream to have the JSONArchive available to all OS platforms, 
and programming languages. 
Please help grow a new generation by:
1. Replicating it to other languages
2. Finding stunning uses for JSONArchive
3. Solving one of the problems listed in the TODO section
4. Resuse it in your repositories
5. Creating softwares to enable OSes use it
6. Telling a friend or your organization about it.
7. Help build another public version ( contact: richardmcfriend@live.com if interested )
8. Adding more TODO.


Please I would like a link to any form of addition to the code or TODO, replication to another language,
redevelopment, success stories, and/or softwares developed for or on JSONArchive.
